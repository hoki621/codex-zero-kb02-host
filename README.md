# codex-zero-kb02-host

Herdr and USB CDC Host bridge for the unofficial
[`codex-zero-kb02`](https://github.com/hoki621/codex-zero-kb02) project.

Implementation work is tracked in the parent repository. This repository owns
Herdr state collection, stable agent-slot assignment, USB CDC transport, and
safe allow-listed physical controls. It does not own TinyGo firmware.

Print a complete CDC state frame without opening a serial device:

```sh
npm run dry-run -- WIBDUE
```

At runtime, `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` devices must answer `HELLO ZERO-KB02 1`.
If more than one does, set `ZERO_KB02_PORT` to the intended path.
