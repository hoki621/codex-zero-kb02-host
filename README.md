# codex-zero-kb02-host

Herdr and USB CDC Host bridge for the unofficial
[`codex-zero-kb02`](https://github.com/hoki621/codex-zero-kb02) project.

Implementation work is tracked in the parent repository. This repository owns
Herdr state collection, stable agent-slot assignment, USB CDC transport, and
safe allow-listed physical controls. It does not own TinyGo firmware.

Print a complete CDC state frame without opening a serial device:

```sh
npm run dry-run -- WIBDUE
```

Run the bridge from a normal terminal outside Herdr-managed panes after
installing dependencies:

```sh
npm ci
HERDR_SOCKET_PATH="$HOME/.config/herdr/herdr.sock" ZERO_KB02_PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemzero_kb02_v11 npm start
```

Set `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` explicitly so the bridge can reconnect after a Herdr
server restart. `ZERO_KB02_PORT` is optional when exactly one connected USB CDC
device answers the v1 handshake. Stop the bridge with Ctrl-C. It sends
`OFFLINE` while Herdr is unavailable, retries USB and Herdr connections, and
reconciles missed Herdr events every five seconds.

At runtime, `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` devices must answer `HELLO ZERO-KB02 1`.
If more than one does, set `ZERO_KB02_PORT` to the intended path.

## v1 input mapping

| Physical key | CDC event | Host action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K1 | unavailable | reserved; Escape not implemented |
| K2 | `KEY <generation> 0 DOWN` | focus agent slot 0 |
| K3 | `KEY <generation> 1 DOWN` | focus agent slot 1 |
| K4 | unavailable | reserved; Popup not implemented |
| K5 | `KEY <generation> 2 DOWN` | focus agent slot 2 |
| K6 | `KEY <generation> 3 DOWN` | focus agent slot 3 |
| K7 | `KEY <generation> 4 DOWN` | focus agent slot 4 |
| K8 | `KEY <generation> 5 DOWN` | focus agent slot 5 |
| K9–K12 | unavailable | reserved; no operation |

`KEY UP`, `ENC`, `JOY`, and joystick push perform no operation in v1.
